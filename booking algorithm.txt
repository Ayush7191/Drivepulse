Here's a step-by-step **algorithm** for implementing a car rental process where users book a car by providing details like date, time, place, and passenger details:

---

### **1. Input Booking Details**
- **Input**: Date, Time, Pickup Location, Drop-off Location.
- **Validation**:
  - Ensure the date and time are in the future.
  - Validate the pickup and drop-off locations to match service coverage.
- **Output**: Validated booking details.

---

### **2. Check Car Availability**
- **Query Database**:
  - Use the provided booking date, time, and location to fetch available cars.
  - SQL Query Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM cars 
    WHERE availability = 'Available' 
    AND location = 'PickupLocation' 
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM bookings 
        WHERE cars.id = bookings.car_id 
        AND bookings.start_time <= 'SelectedEndTime'
        AND bookings.end_time >= 'SelectedStartTime'
    );
    ```
- **Output**: List of available cars.

---

### **3. Display Cars for Selection**
- **UI/UX**:
  - Show available cars with details such as:
    - Car type, transmission, fuel type, price, seating capacity.
    - Images and ratings for better user experience.
  - Add a "Book Now" button for each car.

---

### **4. Select a Car**
- **Input**: User selects a car from the list.
- **Validation**:
  - Ensure the selected car is still available (optional recheck).
- **Output**: Car ID of the selected car.

---

### **5. Passenger Details Form**
- **Input**:
  - Full Name, Contact Number, Email Address.
  - Number of Passengers.
  - Additional options (child seat, GPS, etc.).
- **Validation**:
  - Contact Number: Ensure it's a valid phone number.
  - Email Address: Validate email format.
  - Number of Passengers: Ensure it doesn't exceed the car's capacity.
- **Output**: Passenger details.

---

### **6. Confirm Booking**
- **Summary Page**:
  - Show booking details (date, time, pickup/drop-off locations).
  - Show selected car details (name, price, type, etc.).
  - Include passenger details.
- **User Action**:
  - Click "Confirm Booking."
  - Optionally add payment processing (if applicable).

---

### **7. Save Booking to Database**
- **Database Tables**:
  - **Bookings Table**:
    - `booking_id`, `car_id`, `user_id`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `pickup_location`, `dropoff_location`, `status`, etc.
  - **Passenger Details Table**:
    - `passenger_id`, `booking_id`, `name`, `contact`, `email`, etc.
- **SQL Query**:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO bookings 
  (car_id, user_id, start_time, end_time, pickup_location, dropoff_location, status) 
  VALUES ('SelectedCarID', 'UserID', 'SelectedStartTime', 'SelectedEndTime', 'PickupLocation', 'DropoffLocation', 'Confirmed');

  INSERT INTO passengers 
  (booking_id, name, contact, email) 
  VALUES ('BookingID', 'PassengerName', 'PassengerContact', 'PassengerEmail');
  ```

---

### **8. Send Confirmation**
- **Email/SMS Notification**:
  - Send booking confirmation with:
    - Booking ID.
    - Car details.
    - Date, time, and location details.
    - Contact information for support.

---

### **9. Handle Cancellations (Optional)**
- Allow users to cancel bookings if needed:
  - Update the booking status to `Cancelled` in the database.

---

### **Algorithm Summary**
1. Collect date, time, and location inputs.
2. Validate inputs and query available cars.
3. Display available cars for selection.
4. Allow the user to select a car.
5. Collect passenger details.
6. Confirm booking and save details in the database.
7. Send confirmation to the user.
8. (Optional) Handle cancellations.

---

### Example Booking Flow:

#### **User Steps**:
1. **Booking Details**: Select date, time, and location.
2. **Car Selection**: Choose a car.
3. **Passenger Details**: Fill in personal information.
4. **Confirmation**: Review booking and confirm.
5. **Completion**: Receive confirmation.
